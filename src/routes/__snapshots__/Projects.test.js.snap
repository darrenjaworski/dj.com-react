    An app to explore coffee shops in Oklahoma City. Designed and built from the ground up to be a hub for coffee people of OKC. However, a lot more work needs to be done on this project. I need to finish collecting data for coffee shops, to develop a suggestion system to lead you to the perfect cup in town, and to actually launch the thing. I'll take a couple of weekends and finish this project over a cup of coffee.

    I felt an earthquake during lunch. I decided to put a couple of minutes into a series of maps and charts that touch on the swarm of induced earthquakes in Oklahoma. Each visualization is updated with real-time earthquake data. I will include more data layers as they become available.
